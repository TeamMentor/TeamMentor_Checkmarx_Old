A Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack occurs when an attacker tricks a victim into loading a page that contains a malicious request. This request may be able to change the state of the web application and is possible because the request is sent in the context of the logged in victim. For many sites each request automatically sends the victim's credentials such as the session cookie or authentication credentials. Due to this fact there is no way to distinguish the false request from a legitimate request. CSRF vulnerabilities affect web applications that allow authenticated users to perform operations that are not available to guest users. To prevent CSRF, include unique tokens in pages that invoke security sensitive operations. To check your application for CSRF, determine whether unique tokens are used in pages that carry out sensitive operations.

Cross Site Request Forgery attacks are known by other names including XSRF, Session Riding, One-Click and Zero-Click attacks. A One-Click attack refers to a link that causes a malicious action to be performed when a victim clicks on it. A Zero-Click attack is automatically executed upon page load. A common way to perform a zero-click attack is to embed the request in the source of an image. 

==Impact==

CSRF allows the attacker to carry out actions on the behalf of an authenticated user by tricking the user into visiting a malicious page or link. The exact impact depends on what functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. The attacker will usually try to add a privileged user account for himself or to inject arbitrary code into the application. If either of those scenarios succeeds, the attacker gains full control of the application.

==Countermeasures==

Use unique tokens in sensitive requests:

Ask the user for confirmation for sensitive operations:

==Checklists==

Unique tokens are used in sensitive requests:
* [[0af6f77b-e96e-436c-83bf-3c840eb7ffb8|ViewStateUserKey Is Used to Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery]]

Users are asked for confirmation for sensitive operations:
